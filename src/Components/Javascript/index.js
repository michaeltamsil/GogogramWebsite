                        an essential web technology along with HTML and CSS, as most browsers implement
                        JavaScript. Thus, You must learn JavaScript if you want to get into web
                        development, and you must learn it well if you're planning on being a front-end
                        developer or on using JavaScript for backend development. Furthermore,
                        JavaScript usage has now extended to mobile app development, desktop app
                        development, and game development. All in all, it has exploded in popularity and
                        is now a very useful skill to learn.

                        main reason what is javascript and why use it? A software framework is an
                        abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively
                        changed by additional user-written code. JavaScript framework is an application
                        framework written in JavaScript where the programmers can manipulate the
                        functions and use them for their convenience. Frameworks are more adaptable for
                        the designing of websites and hence, they are preferred by most of the website
                        developers. JavaScript frameworks are a type of tool that makes working with
                        JavaScript easier and smoother. These frameworks also make it possible for the
                        programmer to code the application as a device responsive. This responsiveness
                        is yet another reason why the JavaScript frameworks are quite popular when it
                        comes to the question of using a high-level machine language. Letâ€™s have a look
                        at the best JS Frameworks in 2019.
